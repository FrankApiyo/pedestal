= Interceptors

[TIP]
.*See the guide*

This is the detailed interceptor _reference_; if you are new to Pedestal
you may want to start with the xref:guides:what-is-an-interceptor.adoc[].

Interceptors are the basic unit of work in Pedestal. The
core library provides interceptors that are generally useful for
creating HTTP web services. Applications augment those with their own
logic to handle.

An interceptor is a pair of unary functions footnote:[An optional third function is used for error handling.]
An interceptor must provide at least one of :enter, :leave and :error.
Each function is called with a xref:context-map.adoc[] and must return either a context
map or a {core_async} channel that will deliver a context map; the latter case triggers
xref:guides:async.adoc[asynchronous request processing].

Pedestal calls the :enter function on the way "in" to handling a
request. It calls the :leave function on the way back "out". This is
shown here for a single interceptor:

image::guides:interceptors.png[]

Either the :enter or :leave function may be omitted without harm.

Logically speaking, interceptors form a queue.
During the :enter phase, the next interceptor is popped off the queue,
pushed onto the leave stack, and it's :enter function, if any, is executed.

Once the handler (or other interceptor) adds a :response to the context,
the chain logic switches to :leave mode: it pops interceptors off
the leave stack and invokes the :leave function, if any.

Because it's the leave _stack_ the :leave functions are invoked
in the opposite order from the :enter functions.

image::guides:interceptor-stack.png[]

Both the queue and the stack reside in the context map. Since
interceptors can modify the context map, that means they can change
the plan of execution for the rest of the request! Interceptors are
allowed to enqueue more interceptors to be called, or they can
terminate the request.

This process, of running all the interceptor :enter functions, then running
the interceptor :leave functions, is called _executing the interceptor chain_.

== Context Bindings

Interceptors expect certain keys to be present in the context
map. These _context bindings_ are part of the contract between
provider and interceptors.

The most important keys are :request, which holds the xref:request-map.adoc[], and
:response, which holds the xref:response-map.adoc[].

Further keys are described in the xref:context-map.adoc[] reference.

== Interceptor Return Values

Interceptor functions must return values. Returning `nil` will cause
an internal server error.

An :enter or :leave function may return a context map directly. In
this case, processing continues with the next interceptor.

If the interceptor is expected to take a long time to return a result, it may
instead return a {core_async} channel. Pedestal will yield the request processing thread and
wait for a value to be produced.

Only one value will be consumed from the returned channel, and the value must be a context map.

[IMPORTANT]
.*Chaining With Async Interceptors*
--
Any interceptor downstream of an asynchronous interceptor will be executed in the
{core_async} dispatch thread pool.
This can be problematic if any later interceptor or handler performs any blocking I/O, as the thread pool is a fixed
size. Generally speaking, if any interceptor is asynchronous, all following non-trivial interceptors should also be asynchronous.

Trivial interceptors do short computations or make changes to the context map; they do not perform any I/O or other
operations that could block the thread they execute on, such as any file or socket I/O.

When an interceptor returns a channel, the request processing thread can be returned to the servlet container.
This may allow another pending request to be processed while the initial request is parked, waiting for
the channel returned by an interceptor to convey the new context map.

== IntoInterceptor

The protocol
api:IntoInterceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor]
represents anything that can be used as an interceptor. Pedestal extends that protocol to the following:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Type | Interpretation

| Map
| The :enter, :leave, and :name keys are used directly.

| Function
| The function is interpreted as a "handler". See <<_handlers>>.

| List
| The list is evaluated and its result is used as an interceptor. footnote:[This is supported behavior
  related to the xref:table-syntax.adoc[table router syntax], but is no longer commonly used.]

| Cons
| Same as List

| Symbol
| The symbol is resolved and its target is converted to an interceptor.

| Var
| The var is de-referenced and its value is converted to an interceptor.

|===

Most of these cases are provided to make routing syntax
easier.

Applications should mainly use the map form as shown in the
earlier examples when defining interceptors for routing
purposes.

== Manipulating the interceptor queue

The queue of interceptors remaining to execute is held in the
xref:context-map.adoc[]. This means that an interceptor can
enqueue other interceptors to be executed. In fact, this is exactly how
xref:routing-quick-reference.adoc[routing] works, the router is an interceptor that matches requests and
enqueues the desired interceptors when a route matches.

Use
api:enqueue[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain]
to push more interceptors onto the queue.

Use
api:terminate[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain]
if processing should not continue - though normally, this is accomplished
by attaching a :response map (the xref:response-map.adoc[]) to the xref:context-map.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
.*Interceptor Records*
--
Interceptors that are explicitly enqueued by the application must
be defined using the
api:interceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor]
function. This function takes a value which extends
the IntoInterceptor protocol, and returns an Interceptor record.

This is not necessary when constructing interceptors used in routing
because interceptor representations are transformed to Interceptor
records during route expansion.
--

It's worth noting that when an interceptor queues additional interceptors for execution,
they execute after all interceptors already in the queue (not immediately after the interceptor that
modified the queue).  This means you could, for example, put a routing interceptor first
in the queue, then a few interceptors that provide behavior common to all routes, and those
common interceptors will run before any route-specific interceptors.


== Handlers

A handler function is a special case of an interceptor.
Pedestal treats the handler as a function that takes a xref:request-map.adoc[]
and returns a xref:response-map.adoc[].

A handler does _not_ have access to the full xref:context-map.adoc[execution context],
therefore, it cannot manipulate the interceptor queue.

Because a handler takes one kind of thing (request) and returns a
different kind of thing (response), it can only be used in the last
position of a stack.

Handlers are always synchronous; they must return a response map, not a channel that delivers
a response map.

== Error Handling

Pedestal supports defining interceptor-specific error handlers via the
:error key. Refer to the xref:error-handling.adoc[] reference for more details.

== Pedestal Interceptors

The api:pedestal-service[ns=pedestal.service/index] library includes a large set of interceptors
that are specialized for HTTP request handling.

See the following namespaces for stock interceptors:

- api:io.pedestal.http.body-params[ns=pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.body-params]
- api:io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation[ns=pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation]
- api:io.pedestal.http.cors[ns=pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.cors]
- api:io.pedestal.http.csrf[ns=pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.csrf]
- api:io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares[ns=pedestal.service/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares]

See the following namespaces for routing interceptors:

- api:io.pedestal.http.route[ns=pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route]
- api:io.pedestal.http.route.router[ns=pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.router]
