= Servlet Interceptor

As the name implies, the servlet interceptor is both a servlet and an
interceptor. It is created when an application calls
`io.pedestal.http/create-server` or `io.pedestal.http/create-servlet`.

When created, the servlet interceptor creates the global interceptor queue,
which includes a number of interceptors private to the servlet interceptor, and
additional interceptors provided by the application; importantly, the final interceptor will
perform routing, which will add route-matched interceptors to the queue.

The servlet interceptor is a xref:chain-providers.adoc[chain provider] that
invokes interceptors when an HTTP request arrives.

The servlet interceptor performs the following tasks:

   1. Sets up the xref:context-map.adoc[] and xref:request-map.adoc[]
   2. Executes the interceptor queue (:enter, then :leave)
   3. Catches any exceptions that aren't handled by xref:error-handling.adoc[] within the interceptors
   4. Writes the final response, using the xref:response-map.adoc[]

There are a couple of special cases to note.

## Manipulating the Queue and Stack

Interceptors may rewrite the interceptor queue by calling functions
api:enqueue[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain]
and
api:terminate[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain].

[WARNING]
--
Interceptors may also change the interceptor queue by directly changing the values
of the :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/stack and
:io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/queue in the xref:context-map.adoc[].
This should be avoided when possible, as manipulating the stack and queue improperly
may have unintended consequences.
--

The queue contains the interceptors to be executed next. The first
item in the queue will be the next interceptor considered.
When an interceptor's :enter function is executed, it is removed from the queue and added to the stack.

The stack contains the previously executed interceptors that need their :leave functions
called. The top of the stack will be considered first.

## Early Termination

Before invoking the :enter functions, the servlet interceptor sets
up a _terminator_ predicate on the context.
This predicate is passed the context map and returns a truthy value
if execution should transition from :enter to :leave.

The default predicate checks to see if the :response context key is present and, if so, is
a valid Ring response map; that is, does it have a :status key of type integer, and a :headers key
containing a map?

The end result is that in some cases, interceptors (including handlers) will not get executed for
a particular request.  For example, an application that has a concept of authentication
may include an interceptor that checks for valid credentials in the request, and adds a :response map
to the context when the credentials are missing or invalid. That will cause the response to immediately
be sent to the client, bypassing any later interceptors.

In addition, it is possible to have more than one termination predicate; if any predicate returns
a truthy value, then the :enter execution will terminate.
New predicates can be appended using
api:terminate-when[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain].

## Partial Responses

In very rare cases, different interceptors may provide different parts of response.
Ultimately, the response must be a valid Ring response, but different interceptors may
provide different parts of the response (the :body or certain values in the :headers map).

If your application requires this, be very careful about early termination.

   1. Put the initial value into the response map in the last :enter
   function, then use the :leave functions to refine that value.
   2. Put the initial value into the context under a different key and
   refine that value in either :enter or :leave functions. When
   the response is complete, transfer the response map to the :response key.
