= Hello World

== Welcome

We're glad you've decided to give Pedestal a try. We think it's pretty
powerful. Before we get into the heavy lifting though, we should start
with some basics.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Create a Pedestal project from scratch.
- Define a route.
- Return a page on that route.
- Return plain text in your response.

== Guide Assumptions

This guide is for beginners who are new to Pedestal. It doesn't assume
that you have any prior experience with Pedestal, Clojure, or any
other Clojure-based web framework. You should be familiar with the
basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to xref:your-first-api.adoc[] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

We will be using the Clojure CLI tools to manage dependencies and download
libraries. Refer to the Clojure
link:https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Getting Started] page
for installation instructions and details.

== Getting Help If You're Stuck

include::partial$getting-help.adoc[]


This guide shows fragments of code as we add them. Sometimes it helps
to see the whole thing at once, so you can always check out
<<_the_whole_shebang>> at the end of this guide.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we're going to take a series of small steps. We'll see
all the code to build a Pedestal service starting with an empty
directory.

The first time through, we will just do everything "by hand". This is
a little more work in typing (or copy-and-pasting) but it will let you
see how the pieces connect in the simplest possible use case.

== Before We Begin

Pedestal services are written in Clojure code, which you then run on a
Java Virtual Machine. You will need to have a Java Runtime Environment
installed on your computer. Let's make sure you're up to date. Fire up
a terminal and put in this command:

----
$ java -version
----

You should see some output something like this:

----
> java -version
openjdk version "11.0.19" 2023-04-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-11.0.19.7.1 (build 11.0.19+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-11.0.19.7.1 (build 11.0.19+7-LTS, mixed mode)
----

If you get an error, such as
"Command not found" or some variation of that, you probably need to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html#java[install
Java].

The second thing is to make sure that the Java version is at least
1.7.

OK, so now that you are ready to run a Java applications, let's move on
to the Pedestal part.

== Starting From Scratch

We're going to start this project with an empty directory. In
practice, most of the time you'll generate a project from a
template. But for now, it's more important to see what the pieces are
and how they fit together.

I'm going to call my project 'hello-world'. Feel free to call yours
something different, but it's up to you to do the mental translation
in the rest of this guide.

----
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
----

A quick note on naming style. Clojure itself uses "kebab case" for its
names. That's lowercase words, separated with hyphens. When you have a
long name, it looks like the letters have been skewered. Hence, kebab
case. Since Clojure's own libraries use this style, most applications
and libraries do too.

We need a place to keep our code. By convention, that's in a `src`
directory:

----
$ mkdir src
----

== A Place to Put Things

Now we're going to create a file under "src" to hold our code. Call it
"src/hello.clj". It's going to start with a "namespace declaration". This
tell Clojure what namespace to put the code into. (If you're a Java
programmer, you can think of a namespace as similar to a package
name.)

[source, clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> This namespace is called 'hello'. This almost always matches the filename.
<2> We need to use the `io.pedestal.http` namespace, but would like to only type `http` later in the file.
<3> We need to use the `io.pedestal.http.route` namespace, but would like to spell it as `route` later in the file.

This is very similar to using `import` in Java or `require` in
Ruby. It just makes some names from other namespaces available to us
in this namespace.

If you haven't written any Clojure before, this syntax might look a
little strange. The first thing that jumps out at people is the
parentheses. Why is there an open paren _before_ the "ns"? In Clojure,
every expression is enclosed in its very own set of parentheses. There
are no semicolons to end the line or curly braces to close an "if"
expression. To find the end of any expression, you just find the
matching paren.

The first thing in an expression is the function or a macro to call.
In this case `ns` is a macro that is built in to Clojure. It sets up a
namespace and makes the stuff we :require available.

Speaking of the stuff we require, what is `io.pedestal.http` and
`io.pedestal.http.route`? Those are each namespaces from Pedestal
libraries. The
api:io.pedestal.http[ns=io.pedestal.http]
namespace has functions that let you set up HTTP servers, handle
requests, and send responses. The
api:io.pedestal.http.route[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
namespace actually comes from a library dedicated to routing
(ingeniously named `pedestal.route`.)

Where the :require says :as `something` it means we're making an
alias inside our namespace. So `io.pedestal.http` will be available as
just `http` and `io.pedestal.http.route` will be available as
`route`. Aliases don't change anything about the semantics of the
namespace we're bringing in. They just save us some typing.

Routing is split off into its own library because you can use it by
itself, or you can use the HTTP library with a different routing
layer. We won't need to do that in this guide, but other tutorials do
some pretty amazing things by substituting modules.

Also, don't worry about the indentation. Your editor might handle that
for you, but in any case, Clojure doesn't care about whitespace.

== Generating a Response

Whew. That was a lot to unpack from just the first three lines of
code! Let's pause for a moment to talk about the next steps. We're
making a web service that can say hello. That means we need to do some
basic things:

1. Listen to on a socket for HTTP requests.
2. Figure out what any given request means.
3. Make a response to that request.

We're going to do all of those things, but we're going to do them
_backwards_. In Clojure, you always find the most important,
highest-level functions at the _bottom_ of the file. Whenever I read a
Clojure source file, I start at the bottom and page upward. So the
next thing we're going to do is write a function that can return a
response to a "hello world" request.

[source, clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> Define a function called `respond-hello` that takes a single argument, which we will call `request`
<2> Return a map with two keys and two values.

A Clojure function returns the value of the last expression in the
function. In this case, that will be the map that we construct on line
2. This is in "map literal" syntax, which just means that we're
writing the whole map straight in the source code rather than building
it up by calling functions.

The map has two keys and their values:

* :status 200
* :body   "Hello, world!"

That's the whole thing. When our function returns that map, Pedestal
will translate that into a full HTTP response complete with content
type header and everything.

[sidebar]
Later on, we'll see how to take control
of the xref:hello-world-content-types.adoc[whole response]. For now we're
just taking the easy road.

There's absolutely nothing special about this map. It's a plain old
Clojure map - this is how Clojure operates, we don't use classes, we
use ordinary maps but care about what particular keys are in the map.
This is a xref:reference:response-map.adoc[].

Clojure is a _functional language_, which means that whenever possible,
we create simple functions that have no side-effects: their behavior is defined
only by the arguments passed in.

This trivial `respond-hello` handler function is functional -- it can be tested entirely
by invoking it, passing in a request map, and making assertions about at the response map it returns.
There's no need to start up a server and send a request to it via HTTP, you can just
have your tests call this code directly.

That's one of the beauties of working in
Clojure and Pedestal... you can try everything interactively in a running
system. Let's do that before we move on.

== Managing Dependencies

Pedestal is built on the shoulders of giants, in the form of great
open source technology that many people have contributed to. That
gives us great power, but with great power comes great
dependencies. We could download all the jar files we need and string
together a classpath, but it's a huge pain. I just made a minimal
project and found 57 entries on the classpath.

This is why we _can_ have nice things, but it means we need some help
managing those dependencies. Fortunately, Clojure provides tooling for
dependency management. We'll be using the `clj` tool to run our
examples. Please take a few minutes to
link:https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli[learn more], then come
back and we'll continue.

Now we can make a `deps.edn` that tells the `clj` tool what libraries our
service needs. This goes in the main directory `hello`:


[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$hello/deps.edn[]
----
<1> Tell `clj` we need pedestal.jetty and a logging library.
<2> Tell `clj` where our source code lives.

We talked about `pedestal.service` and `pedestal.route` before, but we
have a new one here. Pedestal works with many different HTTP servers,
so we don't want the core library to depend on _all_ of the possible
servers out there. Instead, we let you decide which one to use by
adding the library for your chosen service. We're using
http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] for this guide. It is a fast,
stable, and mature HTTP server. Best of all, it doesn't require any
installation ahead of time... we can start it up from inside our
service. That makes our service more self-contained and portable.

Let's try out our response function.

----
> clj
Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.jetty/0.6.1/pedestal.jetty-0.6.1.pom from clojars
Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.service/0.6.1/pedestal.service-0.6.1.pom from clojars
Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.log/0.6.1/pedestal.log-0.6.1.pom from clojars

Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.route/0.6.1/pedestal.route-0.6.1.jar from clojars
Clojure 1.11.1
user=>
----

[NOTE]
The downloads only occur the _first_ time you run the service; you can also see
that the pedestal.jetty library brings in further dependencies on the other parts of Pedestal: pedestal.log, pedestal.service, etc.

The `clj` tool will download dependencies as needed, add them to the classpath
and start a repl in the `user` namespace. Now we're able to 
enter Clojure code to evaluate it (turn it into a value). The first
thing we need to do is tell Clojure about our `hello` namespace:

----
user=> (require 'hello)
nil
user=>
----
The `require`
function returns nil on success, which the Clojure REPL printed.

If instead, you get a message like this:

[source]
----
user=> (require hello)
Syntax error compiling at (REPL:1:1).
Unable to resolve symbol: hello in this context
----

It means you missed the single-quote before "hello" in the `require.`

Now we can actually test the function:

----
user=> (hello/respond-hello {})
{:status 200, :body "Hello, world!"}
----

Well, we got the singularly unexciting result that we can call a
function and it returns the map that we told it to. Let's move on to
hooking this up to a route.

It's worth noting that we passed in an empty map (`{}`) rather than a full request map.
This is perfectly acceptable for testing; in fact we could have even passed a `nil`,
as the `respond-hello` function doesn't actually use the request parameter.

== Routes

In Pedestal, routing is the process of matching an incoming request to
a handler footnote:[We're simplifying here, we'll get around to discussing
_interceptors_ soon].

Let's tell Pedestal that we want the route `GET /greet` to map to our
handler function:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]
----
<1> We specify routes in a short notation, but they must be expanded and turned into a Router for use.
<2> This is the "table syntax". There are xref:reference:routing-quick-reference.adoc[several formats]
that can be passed to api:expand-routes[ns=io.pedestal.html.route].

This routing table is a single route; the route matches:

* The GET HTTP method
* The URL `/greet`

When routed in a live service, the `respond-hello` function will be invoked.
We've named this route :greet. Every route must have a unique
name, though in many cases, Pedestal can automatically provide a reasonable name.

We're building up gradually, and have yet to hook this up to an HTTP server, but it's still possible
to test the routing by hand (using code that could eventually be used in a test suite).

----
user=> (require :reload 'hello)
nil
user=> (require '[io.pedestal.http.route :as route])
nil
user=> (route/try-routing-for hello/routes :prefix-tree "/greet" :get)
{:path "/greet", :method :get, :path-re #"/\Qgreet\E", :path-parts ["greet"], :interceptors [#Interceptor{:name }], :route-name :greet, :path-params {}, :io.pedestal.http.route.prefix-tree/satisfies-constraints? #object[clojure.core$constantly$fn__6443 0x6182d451 "clojure.core$constantly$fn__6443@6182d451"]}
user=> (route/try-routing-for hello/routes :prefix-tree "/greet" :post)
nil
user=> (route/try-routing-for hello/routes :prefix-tree "/greet" :put)
nil
----

The first thing we need to do is tell Clojure to reload the latest
code from `hello.clj`. That's what the :reload keyword does in the
`require` call. Without that, you'll get a "cannot resolve symbol"
error when you try to reference `hello/routes`.

The function api:try-routing-for[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] lets us ask "What would Pedestal do?"
with an incoming HTTP request. We gave it our table of one route, a
magic keyword :prefix-tree, then the query string and HTTP verb.

`try-routing-for` uses the example routing table, from `hello/routes`, and the router type, :prefix-tree,
to create a temporary router; it then passes the provided method (:get) and path, `/greet`,
so see how it would be routed; if the route matches, a _routing entry_ is returned, which identifies
what was matched, and would be used in a live Pedestal application.

When no route in the table matches, `try-routing-for` will return nil. The  REPL sessions shows
that a GET to `/greet` will be match, but a PUT or POST will not.

On a match, `try-routing-for` returns an expanded version of the route that was matched (this is
the internal format, which is much more cumbersome than the table format we used to define
the route); further, some specific details about what was matched was also included.

You might ask, "where is my `respond-hello` function in all that?" ... part of
what `expand-routes` does is to convert your handler function into Pedestal's
native unit of work, an xref:guides:what-is-an-interceptor[interceptor].

== Hooking It All Up

We're ready for that last step: connecting everything to an HTTP
server. That's one more function (at the end of the file) to create
the server.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=server]
----
<1> `io.pedestal.http/create-server` is a convenience function that builds everything in one step.
<2> This is where we tell Pedestal which routes to use for this service.
<3> We tell Pedestal that we want to use Jetty as our HTTP responder.
<4> Port 8080 is so boring. We'll use something different, but not _too_ different.
<5> Start the server. This will not return.

All we need to do now is run it.

----
user=> (require :reload 'hello)
nil
user=> (hello/start)
----

Yep, it didn't return. Jetty is running and listening for connections,
though. Flip to a different window and try curl or use a browser to hit
http://127.0.0.1:8890/greet.

----
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8890/greet

----

It's alive! Treat yourself to a hot beverage and a high five. Whenever
you get tired of poking it, just hit Control-C in the terminal that is
running the server to kill it.

Later on, we'll see how to make Jetty
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc#_interactive_development[run on its own thread] so
you can get your REPL prompt back.

== The Whole Shebang

This might seem complicated because I've used so many words to
describe all this. The code is pretty short though. For reference, and
in case you've hit any snags along the way, here are the complete
contents of both files.

You can also see all the code in the GitHub repository for
link:{guides_examples_root}/hello[this guide].

== The Path So Far

We've covered a lot of ground in this guide. You have learned how to:

* Start a Pedestal project from scratch.
* Write a function to return a response.
* Define routes for Pedestal.
* Run a Jetty server that handles those routes.

Along the way you've also learned a bit of Clojure and some debugging
tricks.

== Where to Next?

The xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[next part] in this tutorial adds
the ability to receive a query parameter, apply logic to it, and
return a different response for an error.
