= What is Pedestal?

image::animated-front-page-sample.gif[float="right",width=300]

Pedestal is a set of libraries that we use to build services and applications. It runs in the back end and can serve up whole HTML pages or handle API requests.

There are a lot of tools in that space, so why did we build Pedestal? We had two main reasons:

* **Pedestal is designed for APIs first.** Most web app frameworks still focus on the "page model" and server side rendering. Pedestal lets you start simple and add that if you need it.
* **Pedestal makes it easy to create _live_ applications.** Applications must respond with immediate feedback even while some back-end communication goes on. Pedestal makes it easy to deliver server-sent events and asynchronous updates.
