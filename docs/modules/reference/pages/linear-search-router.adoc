= Linear Search Router

== Motivation

Provides the user with the most control over routing outside of
implementing a custom router.

== Why use it?

You require precise control over routing and the routing performance
tradeoff is acceptable to your service.

== How to use it?

Add the key :io.pedestal.http/router to the service map with the
value :linear-search.

== Caveats

This implementation routes requests in linear time, so it's the simplest and slowest of Pedestal's router implementations.

== Additional Notes

Pedestal's first router implementation. 

Query and path constraints are used in routing decisions unlike the
xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[] or xref:map-tree-router.adoc[].
