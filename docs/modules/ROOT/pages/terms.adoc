# Terminology

Understanding Pedestal comes with the challenge of unpacking a number of terms - some specific to Pedestal, others
inherited from the underlying technologies Pedestal extends from.

interceptor::
An xref:guides:what-is-an-interceptor.adoc[interceptor] is the basic unit of work in Pedestal, a combination of
specific functions related to handling a request or generating a response.

interceptor chain::
A pipeline of interceptors, setup and executed by a chain provider.

chain provider::
Creates and executes an interceptor chain, with some behaviors reflecting a specific domain - the normal domain
is processing HTTP requests.

servlet interceptor::
A chain provider specific to handling HTTP requests from a servlet.

service map::
The xref:reference:service-map.adoc[] is a collection of data that is used to setup request routing and interceptors,
and ultimately create a server.

server::
A server is responsible for low-level communication with HTTP clients; A _server map_ is created from the service map,
and can be used to start and stop the server. Many examples use the xref:reference:jetty.adoc[] server implementation.

handler::
A simple function that is passed a request map and returns a response map; handlers are converted to interceptors internally.

core.async::
The {core_async} library is a Clojure extension that allows for efficient and expressive concurrent processing systems.
The central artifact is a _channel_, a kind of data pipe that allows information to be conveyed between concurrently
running light-weight processes.

servlet::
The standard Java term for a request handler - a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet[servlet]
operates in the context of a server and processes incoming requests.
In Pedestal, a generic servlet is created and configured, and feeds incoming requests into a pipeline of interceptors.

route::
A mapping of an HTTP Verb (such as GET or POST) and a URL path to a specific set of interceptors.

routing::
The process of mapping an incoming request to a route, using a router and a routing specification.

routing specification::
A concise list of routing data, in one of several formats. A routing specification is converted into a routing table.

routing table::
A verbose, expanded version of routes that can be used by a router.

router::
A specific implementation (there are several in Pedestal, with different tradeoffs) responsible for
identifying the route for an incoming request, using a routing table derived from a routing specification.

routing interceptor::
An interceptor whose job is to perform routing; the routing interceptor is constructed from a routing specification
and a router implementation.

REPL::
The *R*{empty}ead *E*{empty}val *P*{empty}rint *L*{empty}oop:
reading Clojure input, evaluating it, and printing the result.
Clojure excels at interactive development.

context map::
The xref:reference:context-map.adoc[] contains data about the ongoing request; a context map is passed to
interceptors, which often return a modified copy of it. Ultimately, the incoming request map and
response map are stored in the context map, along with much other data internal to Pedestal.

request map::
A map of data about the incoming HTTP request, including HTTP verb, URL, and parameters; this is
all the information needed to route and process the request, and is available inside the context map.

response map::
A map of data used to construct and send the HTTP response.
The response map is stored into the context map to trigger the sending of the response.


SLF4J::
The link:https://www.slf4j.org/[Simple Logging Facade for Java], a generic wrapper around several competing
approaches to generating logging output. Pedestal's api:*[io.pedestal.log] logging support works with SLF4J.

Leiningen::
link:https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] is a popular and pervasive Clojure build tool.
Projects with a `project.clj` file at the root are built using Leiningen, which can download dependencies from a Maven repository
on demand.

Maven repository::
A source of Java and Clojure packages, used by the link:https://maven.apache.org/index.html[Maven build tool], but also
by virtually all other similar tools in the Java ecosystem.

clj::
Also called "tools.deps", this is the name of a build tool for Clojure.
link:https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli[clj] is more recent than Leiningen and has a very different model, but can perform the same key functions:
downloading dependencies (from Maven repositories and elsewhere) and running Clojure programs.
Projects with a `deps.edn` file at the root are built using `clj`.
