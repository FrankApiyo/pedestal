= Your First API

== Welcome Back

This is the fourth part in the tutorial. By now, you've built a simple service that vends out
xref:hello-world.adoc[friendly greetings] by
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[name]
and can handle a few
xref:hello-world-content-types.adoc[content types].

We're going to leave our greeting service alone for the time being and
turn our attention to a REST API for some entities. To keep things
simple, we're going to keep the entities in memory. Even so, we will
use the same kind of techniques you would use in a real application.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Use path parameters to identify items
- Generate URLs for new items
- Encode and decode entity bodies

== Guide Assumptions

This guide is for beginners who are new to Pedestal and may
be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any prior experience with a
Clojure-based web framework. You should be familiar with the basics of
HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content types.

You do not need experience with any particular database or persistence
framework.

If you like to jump straight in to the deep end, you might be
interested in the
link:crash-course[Pedestal Crash Course] which
assumes you know quite a bit about Clojure and web frameworks.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

== Getting Help if You're Stuck

include::partial$getting-help.adoc[]

== Where We Are Going

We will start a new project this time. The service will be a simple "to-do"
list that persists only in memory.
We will use the same techniques that we would use to interact with a real database.

We're going to make a REST style API. Our API will have the following
routes:

|===
| Route | Verb | Action | Response

| /todo | POST | Create a new list | 201 with URL of new list
| /todo | GET  | Return query form | 200 with static page
| /todo/:list-id | GET | View a list | 200 with all items
| /todo/:list-id/:item-id | GET | View an item | 200 with item
| /todo/:list-id/:item-id | PUT | Update an item | 200 with updated item
|===

== Setting Up

We will start this project with another empty directory. (Still
avoiding the template projects for now.)

I'm going to call my project 'todo-api'. Feel free to call yours
something different, but it's up to you to do the mental translation
from here on out.

----
$ mkdir todo-api
$ cd todo-api
$ mkdir src
----

This time, we'll set up our `deps.edn` file first. It will be almost
exactly the same as our last one:

[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$todo-api/deps.edn[]
----

Our new source file will start off with the usual namespace
declaration:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=ns]
----

=== Partial Functions

We're going to use some of the same structures from
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[previous tutorials], such
as an `ok` function to build a successful response, but with some differences:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=response_partials]
----


`partial` is a Clojure function that takes a function and
returns a new function that needs fewer arguments - you supply the initial arguments in the call
to `partial`. The returned function keeps track of those initial arguments, and when invoked,
"glues together" the initial arguments and any additional arguments provided to it, and calls the
original function: `response` in this case.

Although created with `def`, the symbols `ok`, `created`, and `accepted`, are all functions, as if
they were created using `defn`.

Why do any of this?  For all that web developers generally know the status codes in their sleep
footnote:[But do you know what status code link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol[418] is for?],
it is more intent of the code that calls these functions is more semantically visible.  And you probably
did go look up code link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_success[201].

=== Routes Up Front

Second, we're going to define all our routes right away, but have them
all use an `echo` handler so we can test the routes separately from
everything else{empty}footnote:[See the
xref:hello-world-content-types.adoc#_an_echo_interceptor[Hello World With Content Types tutorial]
for an explanation of the `echo` interceptor.].

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=routes]
----

Pedestal makes it possible to invoke these routes directly from the REPL, without involving HTTP at all.
This is a nice way to break your work up into incremental steps.
It goes together nicely with the interactive development support we introduced in the
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc#_interactive_development[Hello World, With Parameters tutorial].

== Poking the Routes

Let's try out the routes that we defined in the `main`
namespace. We'll do that using
api:response-for[ns=io.pedestal.test]. This
function exercises our server without going through any actual HTTP
requests.

In Pedestal, the :io.pedestal.http/service-fn key of the service map contains the
_service function_ which is essentially the bridge between Servlet APIs and
Pedestal's interceptor chain.

By extracting the service-fn (which we keep handy when
running in development mode), we can pass it to `response-for` along with the HTTP verb (as a keyword), and the URL:

----

nil
user=> (test/response-for (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn @main/server) :get "/todo")

user=>
----

NOTE: Part of this output -- `[main] INFO ...` -- comes from built-in Pedestal interceptors
for logging requests; the logging output gets mixed into the output from the REPL.

The response is somewhat overwhelmingly verbose because we are using the `echo`
interceptor, so the entire incoming request converted to a string and is nested inside the response. If we
omit the response body, it's easier to observe the most useful parts of the response:

----
user=> (dissoc *1 :body)
{:status 200, :headers {"Strict-Transport-Security" "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains", "X-Frame-Options" "DENY", "X-Content-Type-Options" "nosniff", "X-XSS-Protection" "1; mode=block", "X-Download-Options" "noopen", "X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies" "none", "Content-Security-Policy" "object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;", "Content-Type" "application/edn"}}
----

[TIP]
Inside the REPL, Clojure keeps track of the most recent result it printed in the
symbol `*1`.  That makes it a snap to dig down into that result. There's also `*2` and `*3`.

Now we can see the status code (200, OK) and the headers. Not
too bad. What happens if we ask for a route that doesn't exist? Or a
verb that isn't supported on a real route?

----
user=> (dissoc (test/response-for (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn @main/server) :get "/no-such-route") :body)
[main] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "GET /no-such-route", :line 80}
{:status 404, :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
user=> (dissoc (test/response-for (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn @main/server) :delete "/todo") :body)
[main] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "DELETE /todo", :line 80}
{:status 404, :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
user=>
----

This 404 response comes from Pedestal itself. That is the default
response when the router cannot find a route that matches the URL
pattern _and_ passes constraints. (For much more about routers, see the
xref:reference:routing-quick-reference.adoc[]).

=== Path Parameters

Some of our routes have parameters in them. Those look like keywords
embedded in the URL patterns. That tells Pedestal to match any value
in that position (except a slash!) and bind it to that parameter in
the xref:reference:request-map.adoc[]. We should be able to
see those parameters in the requests that `echo` will send back
to us. This is one of the ways we can make sure that routes do what we
think they are going to do, before we write the real logic.

----

----

The interesting part here is kind of buried inside the request map
(which is a string inside the response body). We can pull it out with
a bit of Clojure code, but I'll just highlight it here. (If you're
interested in an exercise, try using `clojure.edn` to extract the
request.)

Inside the request, there is a map :path-params which looks like
this:

[source,clojure]
----
:path-params {:list-id "abcdef", :item-id "12345"}}
----

Pedestal extracted these parameters from the URL and bound them to
the request for us. Note that the values are always strings, because
URLs are strings. If we want to treat "12345" as a number, that's up
to us. But our application had better not break if some sly user sends
us up a request with something other than numbers there.

== Create List

The first request to handle is creating lists. This is a POST to the
`/todo` URL. In the interest of simplicity, the only part of a request
body we need is a name field. Also in the interest of simplicity, we
are not going to deal with content negotiation yet.

What do we need to do in order to create a list?

1. Make a new data structure for the list.
2. Add it to our repository.


Without getting too far ahead of ourselves, we'd like to avoid doing all of the above
in a single handler function, and instead, break this up into several interceptors, each
of which is (as much as possible) side-effect free and easily testable.

Let's break the behavior up into multiple steps, and give each step a provisional name:

1. `A` attaches a database connection to the request.
2. `B` looks up an item of interest and attaches it to
the request.
3. `C` makes some decisions and attaches the result of
those decisions to the request.
4. `D` executes a transaction with those decisions.

This way, `A` and `D` are quite generic.
`B` is somewhat specific to the particular route -- is it a list or a list item that's being looked up?.
That leaves `C` which is most specific to a single route, and might event  be a simple handler function.

For this guide, we are going to cheat and create an in-memory
repository:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=repository]
----
<1> Using clj:defonce[] here ensures that the value, the database atom, will survive when we reload
the namespace.

And the interceptor to snapshot the database and handle transactions:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=db_interceptor]
----
<1> `@database` gets the current value of the atom. We attach it to
the request inside the context. This is step `A` from above.
<2> The :tx-data key on the context may be set by other
interceptors. This is step `D` from above.
<3> The `do` block is a sure sign of a side effect. The `swap!` here is our stand-in for a real database transaction.
<4> We attach the updated database value in case any other
interceptors need to use it. We use the latest version of the database (via `@database`), not the
value in the request, to account for any concurrent threads changing the database simultaneously.
<5> If there wasn't any tx-data, we just return the context without
changes. If you forget this and return nil, every request will respond
with 404.

Now we need a handler to receive the request, extract a name, and
create the actual list.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj

<1> If there was a query parameter, use it. Otherwise use a placeholder.
<2> Generate a unique ID. In a real service, the DB itself would do
this for us.
<3> Don't modify the DB here. Attach data to the context that the
db-interceptor will use.
<4> We modify the route definition to use both new interceptors, in
order.

There are a couple of things to notice about this updated route
definition. First, instead of using `echo` here, we have a vector with
our `db-interceptor` and `list-create` interceptors. Recall from
xref:hello-world-content-types.adoc#_interceptors[the introduction to
interceptors] that interceptors have two functions. The :enter
functions get called from left to right, then the :leave functions
get called from right to left. That means calls to the
`db-interceptor` bracket the call to the `list-create` interceptor.

The second thing about the new route is that we removed the
`:route-name :list-create` clause. Pedestal requires that every route
must have a unique name. When we used the `echo` interceptor
everywhere, there was no way for Pedestal to create unique, meaningful
names for the routes so we had to help it out. Now, `list-create` has
it's own name so we can let Pedestal do it's default behavior: use the
name of the last interceptor in the vector.

[TIP]
When you use a function in a route, Pedestal also can't
pick a good name for you. There are quoting forms you can read
about in the
xref:reference:routing-quick-reference.adoc[routing reference] that offer some tricks for that.

=== First Attempt

Let's give this a try. Here's a new helper function to make it easier to
try requests out interactively:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=test_request]
----

With this new helper we can try out a lot of requests from the REPL.
Don't forget to reload the main namespace in the REPL with `(require
:reload 'main)` and restart the server with `(main/restart)` before
you do.

----
user> (main/test-request :post "/todo?name=A-List")
{:status 404, :body "Not Found", :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
----

Uh oh. What happened here? We just tried this route a minute ago. Was
it the query parameter?

----
user> (main/test-request :post "/todo")
{:status 404, :body "Not Found", :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
----

Nope.

If you check the contents of your in-memory database by running
`@main/database` in the REPL, you'll see the new item in there:


----
user=> @main/database
{"l15385" {:name "A-List", :items {}}}
----

So why did Pedestal return 404 response?

The problem is that neither of the `list-create` and `db-interceptor`
interceptors attached any kind of response to the context. Pedestal
looked at the context after running all the interceptors, saw that
there was no response, and sent the 404 as a fallback. We need to
attach a response somewhere.

=== url-for

In REST apis, it is expected that a POST request that creates an entity will
then return a response with a 201 Created status code, and include a
Location header that points to the new resource.

We have defined a route for that, :get `/todo/:list-id`, which we've named
:list-view, and, knowing the list id, it's quite straight forward to assemble that string.

But should our handler code be responsible for doing so? Anyone with experience in web development
knows that things shift around constantly, and should a change to the routing necessitate changes to
some scattered collection of handlers?  Even if the routing table is stable, we want to avoid duplicated code.

Pedestal provides the api:url-for[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] function to generate a URL from route name,
and will even interpolate parameters into the URL string. So our `list-create`
interceptor can point the client over to a route that will render the
new list.

Of course, it would be nice if the response body also included the
current state of the just-created list. That saves the client a round
trip and saves the service a request. For now, we can do this all in
a single interceptor.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=list_create_with_response]
----
<1> Generate URL for route :list-view and the new ID we just generated. Pedestal uses some hidden
machinery{empty}footnote:[A private, thread-bound var.] to get the routing table, which is needed to construct the URL.

And the results (manually formatted for readability):

----
user> (main/test-request :post "/todo?name=A")
{:status 201,
 :body "{:name \"A\", :items []}", <1>
 :headers {"Strict-Transport-Security" "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains",
           "X-Frame-Options" "DENY",
           "X-Content-Type-Options" "nosniff",
           "X-XSS-Protection" "1; mode=block",
           "Location" "/todo/l30488", <2>
           "Content-Type" "application/edn"}} <3>
----
<1> The created list, as map encoded as a string.
<2> The location, generated by `url-for`.
<3> The Clojure map was converting a string by a default Pedestal interceptor, which also applied the matching content type.

In general, adding something
to the database might cause it to change. Sometimes there are triggers
or stored procedures that change it. Other times it's just an ID being
assigned. Usually, instead of attaching the new entity here, I would
attach its ID to the context and use _another_ interceptor later in
the chain to look up the entity after `db-interceptor` executes the
transaction.

This becomes especially important when you are updating existing
entities that could have concurrent changes from many sources.

== View List

Now that we've done one route, this will go a bit faster. The
connection from route to interceptor to entity should be a bit more
evident at this point.

To view a list, we need to look it up from the "database". If it
doesn't exist, we need to return a 404 (which can be done by omitting
a response body). If it does exist, we send it in the response.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=list_view]
----
<1> Query the in-memory database.
<2> Extract the path parameter, if present.
<3> Lookup the matching list if the parameter was provided.
<4> If a list was found, add it to the context as :result; otherwise do nothing resulting in a 404 response.

== Add Item to List

As we build up a set of interceptors and utility functions, we find that we can go ever faster. Next up,
we'll look at adding a new item to an existing list.

To add an item to a list we will perform the following steps:

1. Check that the list exists
2. Create a new item for the list
3. Add that item to the list
4. Return a response with the new item

Someone with a seasoned eye may notice that we have multiple steps that could cause
problems in heavily used, multi-threaded server:

- What if the list is deleted by some other thread between steps 1 and 2?
- What if another item is added to the list between steps 1 and 3 (do we lose one of the items?)

This is the kind of thing that is really important to do
_atomically_. We can take advantage of that Clojure atom to execute a
function atomically. That's what the `swap!` call does for us.

But since that function might not succeed, it means we don't know
enough to create the response inside the `list-item-create`
interceptor. We need to defer response creation until after the
`db-interceptor` runs its `leave` function. Basically, we need
something to look up an item by its list ID and item ID, then render
the result.

That's exactly what we would do for the :list-item-view route! We
can get some reuse here. If `list-item-create` can add the item to the
database, then the item will exist. If the item can't be added, it will result in a  404 response.

We just need to do something a little funky-looking with the `list-item-view`
interceptor. We need to put its behavior in the `leave` function
instead of the `enter` function.

Here's the pair of new interceptors, plus the updated route table.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::example$todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=list_item_create]
----
<1> New generic interceptor that provides a 200 OK response with EDN
body out of any Clojure data structure.
<2> New interceptor that looks up list items but doesn't attach a
response (since that's `entity-render`'s job).
<3> Instead, `list-item-view` attaches the result to the context where
`entity-render` expects to find it.
<4> This interceptor creates an item and sets up tx-data to be
executed.
<5> This is where `list-item-create` passes a parameter to
`list-item-view`.

To understand the interceptors for the :list-item-create route, we
need to think about `enter` functions from left to right and `leave`
functions from right to left.

|===
| Phase | Interceptor | Action

| Enter | `entity-render` | None.
| Enter | `list-item-view` | None.
| Enter | `db-interceptor` | Attach the database value to the context.
| Enter | `list-item-create` | Attach tx-data to the context and a
  path-param to identify the item.
| Leave | `list-item-create` | None.
| Leave | `db-interceptor` | Execute the tx-data, attach updated DB value to context.
| Leave | `list-item-view` | Find the (new) item by path-params,
  attach it to the context as :result.
| Leave | `entity-render` | Find :result on the context, make an OK response.

|===

WARNING: A defect here is that when adding a list item, we don't return a 201 response and a Location header as we do when
adding a list. Implementing that should be an additional section in this tutorial.

Splitting the work into these pipelined stages allows us to make very
small, very targeted functions that collaborate via the context.

The rest of the routes follow these same basic patterns. Take a few
minutes to see if you can create the interceptors for the next few.

== The Whole Shebang

Here is the final version of the code. Everything is cleaned, folded,
and sorted nicely.

== The Path So Far

In this guide, we have built a new API with an in-memory
database. You're ready to go get funding and launch!

We covered some more advanced concepts with interceptors this time:

* Passing results from one interceptor to another
* Reusing interceptors in different routes
* Separating query from transaction with `enter` and `leave` functions
* Testing our routes interactively at a REPL.
