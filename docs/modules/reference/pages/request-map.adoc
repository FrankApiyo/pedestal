= Request Map
:reftext: request map
:navtitle: Request Map

The request map is attached to the xref:context-map.adoc[]
before the first interceptor is invoked. The request map describes the
incoming HTTP request, including information about the remote
endpoint.

Pedestal does not attach metadata to the request map.

When processing, take care to modify the map (e.g., use `assoc`), rather than constructing
a new map entirely. Interceptors may add arbitrary keys to the request map, and the interceptors' functionality
may depend on getting stored values back out of the request map.

Pedestal uses an extended version of the link:https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/blob/master/SPEC[Ring request specification].
